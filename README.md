# MS Access Libraries

This is a collection on standalone libraries for MS Access projects. This is a WIP, I do not suggesting using in any sort of production project at this time.

The basic idea is to pull libraries references into your main project programmatically and automatically. To do this, we can save all libraries as `.accda` files, and place them all in one folder called `libraries`, then when the database is opened, we loop through these libraries and add them as references to your project. 

This keeps your main application clean and only having the business login unique to your project.

## Installation

1. Download the library(ies) that you want to use
2. Create a `libraries` folder in your project root 
3. Add the `addReferences` function below to your main project
4. Ensure that this `addReferences` function is called when you open the database

```vba
Public Function addReferences()

On Error Resume Next

    Dim fileObj, FSO As Object
    Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    For Each fileObj In FSO.GetFolder(Application.CurrentProject.path & "\libraries").files
        If FSO.GetExtensionName(fileObj.path) = "accda" Then
            Application.References.AddFromFile fileObj.path
        End If
    Next
    
End Function
```

## Usage

To use any public function defined in the libaries, simpy call them. If there may be a case where you have the same function defined in your main project, call the function specifically from the library, for example `libraryName.functionName`
